Recommended Source Ports
------------------------
id Software is famous in the open source community for their tradition of releasing their games' source code. As a result of this, many forks of their engines exist, known as "source ports". It is recommended that you use source ports over id's packages as they are usually maintained even to this day, while often including new features (such as better support for our platform, haw haw).
Each game listed below has a source port recommended by flibitijibibo. Some will have others listed as well, for the purposes of completion.
Note that id games without source releases are not listed here. They are listed in their proper sections elsewhere on this wiki, if it is native at all.
